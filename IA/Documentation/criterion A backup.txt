Criterion A: Planning
My Mom does the cooking for our entire household of six and it can be difficult for her 
to plan meals in advance. I had the idea to create a meal planner to replace her messy, scattered 
notebooks and help her stay more organized while planning meals more easily. My Dad is going to 
help as my advisor, he has worked in high tech all his live and has plenty of experience and knowledge 
to help point me in the right direction when I get stuck.
My basic idea is to create a web-app that uses Java as its backend to organize, keep track of, and 
store recipes. The web app will have features such as being able to display what meals will be 
prepared on what days, the ingredients these meals need, and provide a shopping list of ingredients 
to make these meals. After consulting my Dad, he said it should be relatively easy to host the website 
using a service like GitHub pages, and I have previous experience with HTML and CSS from my Web Design 
Course. As for security issues, user data could be secured using an account with an e-mail tied to a 
password to prevent users from being able to access each other’s data.

My success criteria are…
-	Website displays with correct style
-	User is able to log in and access their stored information
-	User is able to store new information
